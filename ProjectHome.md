[Test Dept.](http://code.google.com/p/test-dept/wiki/TestDept) is an ease-of-use framework for unit testing. It is suitable for pure C-code and consists of assertions macros and makefile snippets for automated tests. The framework provides runtime stubbing of functions. Test suites are standalone binaries following a certain specification and can thus be used by arbitrary test-runners.
